<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p class="large">
Hi! I am Nick Kelly, a M.S. student in Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems at the <a
	href="http://www.ece.utexas.edu">University of Texas at Austin</a> graduating in May, 2016.
Currently, I work on error modeling and injection in <a href="https://lph.ece.utexas.edu">LPH</a>,
led by <a href="https://lph.ece.utexas.edu/merez/MattanErez/Home">Mattan Erez</a>.
In general, I am interested in low-energy and resilient architectures, micro-architecture, graphics,
and compilation techniques.

I graduated from <a href="http://eecs.oregonstate.edu">Oregon State University</a> with a B.S. in
Electrical and Computer Engineering in June 2013. During my final year, I focused on topics relating
to computer engineering and analog/circuit design.

Additionally, I have done a lot work in web development&mdash;spanning multiple languages,
frameworks, and devices. Please see my <a href="/papers/resume.pdf">resume</a>, <a
