<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p class="large">
Hi, I am Nick Kelly! I currently work at Intel in Hillsboro as a CPU architect doing performance
modeling.  In general, I am interested in low-energy and resilient architectures,
micro-architecture, graphics, and compilation techniques. Unprofessionally, I enjoy rock climbing,
running, drawing, and anything outdoor related.
</p>

<p class="large">
I graduated from <a href="http://www.ece.utexas.edu">University of Texas at Austin</a>
with a M.S. in Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems (May 2016). While there, I worked on error
modeling and injection in <a href="https://lph.ece.utexas.edu">LPH</a>, led by <a
href="https://lph.ece.utexas.edu/merez/MattanErez/Home">Mattan Erez</a>.  I did my undergraduate 
studies at <a href="http://eecs.oregonstate.edu">Oregon State University</a> in Electrical 
and Computer Engineering (June 2013). During my final year, I focused
on topics relating to computer engineering and analog/circuit design.

Additionally, I have done a lot work in web development&mdash;spanning multiple languages,
frameworks, and devices. Have a look a my resumes for more information:
