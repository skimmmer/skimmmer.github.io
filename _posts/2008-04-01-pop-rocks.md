Asteroids and enemies will be created to the beat of the music. Shoot asteroids for points and
power-ups (firing for most power-ups is needed). When your ship spins out of control, turn the
opposite way to counter-act it. You can use your shield to block damage it will regenerate over
time. Blackholes will be created on large beats or changes in music, avoid them as well as the
asteroids being drawn in. Meteor showers will send meteors moving in different directions. Meteors
will damage asteriods/units but also your ship, unless shielded.
