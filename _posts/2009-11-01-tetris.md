This is my attempt of replicating the game: Tetris. I've always wanted to know how it worked or try
to replicate it. It seems that while it seems simple, most of the work goes into performance. My
version is completely based upon arrays and array transformations. I was eventually thinking of
making an AI to go with the game, but there are other things that need to be added/changed.
