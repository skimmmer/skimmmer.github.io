Rundezvous was a running/activity tracking website. It allows users to track activities, create
events, map out trails, and create groups. All types of posts are integrated together, allowing for
easy activity creation beased upon events or trails. For this project, I created a custom PHP
backend which connected to a MySQL database. Additionally, all styles and graphics were designed by
me (Illustrator/Photoshop).
