A reaction-type game in which you must click all the green boxes before the timer runs out,
otherwise you lose a life. There are 54 levels total, each increasing in difficulty. And on each
level you must go through 5 sets of highlighted boxes. You get points based off of how quickly you
click the boxes and retrying a level deducts 150 pts from your score. You can submit your score if
it is a high score, though it will clear your game.
