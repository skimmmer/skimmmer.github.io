Artisan takes painting to the next level! It is a way to test your skills and share your creations
with others to test their skills. You can create a painting by choosing a stroke width, picking 5
painting colors and 1 background/base color (any color available). Once you are done you can upload
it online for others to play or keep it on your iPod/iPhone. Play online, local and career levels!
Try to get records/highscores by recreating the painting as accurately as possible.
