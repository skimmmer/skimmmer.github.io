Taskoid was an experiment to improve upon current task applications. The main points of the
application was to enable easy task creation through written text (similar to Remember the Milk).
Other features such as lists, tags, etc would be supported as well. My friend and I planned on
working on a web version of the app as well as mobile versions and a REST API.
