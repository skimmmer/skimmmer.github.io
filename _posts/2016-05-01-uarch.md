Our major design objective was to create a somewhat realistic, in-order, x86
processor. Since it was in-order, maximizing MLP and leveraging locality (to
improve latency) was of utmost importance. Thus we put in features such as:
multiple MSHRs, a Store and Eviction Buffer, Critical-word first, and Memory
Banks with Row buâ†µers. Additionally, in order to ensure instruction throughput,
we added a branch predictor, instruction queue, a banked register file, and
data forwarding (with scoreboarding).
